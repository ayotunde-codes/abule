      <span className="ansTitle">Subsidiarity</span> -  We believe in the power of subsidiarity, a principle of social doctrine that all social bodies exist for the sake of the individual so that what individuals are able to do, society should not take over, and what small societies can do, larger societies should not take over. When we put the power back into the hands of people, we are able to solve our own community problems in a manner that transcends what government initiatives, employer benefits, or local establishments can offer. Blockchain technology will allow us to empower communities through decentralization.

      <span className="ansTitle">Store of Value</span> - Though intrinsic to human existence, the act of caregiving has been grossly undervalued. In the wake of the pandemic, the under economy of caregivers, mothers, the elderly, and those in marginalized communities were the most vulnerable. It is high-time we came together to address this! We are creating crypto tokens of appreciation that truly appreciate in value. We as a community are responsible for setting the value of our digital care currency.

      <span className="ansTitle">Trust & Safety</span> - At the very core of blockchain technology lies the ability to create peer to peer smart contracts, which eliminates middlemen in the value transfer process and enables transparent transactions. It also delivers sophisticated tamper-proof protocols for identity verification, biometrics, background checks, and professional qualification checks. This reduces the risk of interacting with imposters and criminal offenders, and it ensures data privacy by protecting users rights against selling their data to third parties.
